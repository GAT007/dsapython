#Stacks, Queues and Deques

Last in first out principle
Push inserts element to the 'top' of the stack
Pop removes element from the 'top' of the stack

You can use the stacks to reverse the elements of positions
Real life example : Back button on web browser

#Queue overview
Queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of items happens at the 'rear' and old items exit at the 'front'
This is known as 'FIFO' or First in First Out

Note how we have two terms
Enqueue term describes adding a new item to the rear of the queue
Dequeue describes removing an item from the front of the queue

#Deque Overview
A deque is a double ended queue
Insertion/Removal can happen at both ends
So, why is this even necessary?
